Enumerable.Where Method

.Where()
 -> filters a sequence based on a predicate(function to verify each element for a condition)
 -> return an IEnumrable that contains the elements that fit that condition

Example: 
List<string> fruits =
    new List<string> { "apple", "passionfruit", "banana", "mango",
                    "orange", "blueberry", "grape", "strawberry" };

IEnumerable<string> query = fruits.Where(fruit => fruit.Length < 6);

foreach (string fruit in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
/*
 This code produces the following output:

 apple
 mango
 grape
*/

.RemoveRange(Object)
 -> tracks the given object in order to delete it from the database when SaveChanges() is applied.
 -> removes items by index
 -> retruns a void value

.Remove(Object)
 -> it does the exact same thing
 -> removes an item by value
 -> it returns a bool statement

.ExecuteDelete()
 -> deletes the data from the database directly without traking & selecting it
