Mapping Error
 I have to map the object fields aswell for the maping profile to work

Ex:
I wanted to map Dashboard to DashboardDto, but DashboardDto has a List of DashboardTabDto, 
so i need to map DashboardTab to DashboardTabDto ,
then DashboardTabDto has a List of WidgetDto so i need to map Widget to WidgetDto.

I also need to configure the AutoMapper in Startup.cs for the program to know where to get the MappingConfiguration
 services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(MappingProfile).Assembly);
