Eager Loading 
 -> loads all the necessary data, including related data, without waiting for it to be requested
 -> beneficial for performance as it reduces the number of database calls needed

Ex: 
	var userPermission = await context.UserPermissions
					.Include(x => x.Permission)
					.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.UserId == userId && x.Permission.Name == permissionName)
