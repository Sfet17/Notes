Eager Loading 
 -> loads all the necessary data, including related data, without waiting for it to be requested
 -> beneficial for performance as it reduces the number of database calls needed

Ex: 
	var userPermission = await context.UserPermissions
					.Include(x => x.Permission)
					.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.UserId == userId && x.Permission.Name == permissionName)

			->
			->
			->
			->
			->
.SaveChangesAysnc() 
	-> it's only used for putting or changing data into a database, NEVER use it with a GET method
!Always check if something is null, some methods bypass try & catch and must be checked with an if!

.FirstorDefault()
	->returns the first value that matches the lamda condition between () or null if there is none
	->it's a sync method (not well used with aysnc functions, because it will block the worker thread)
	->when using an aysnc function use .FirstorDefaultAsync()

!Blocking the Working Thread!
 ->the thread is used for exclusively for the specific task and can't be used for anything else
		(like a waiter who puts an order and then waits until the order is complete) 
 ->a server has a finite amount of working threads, so when most of them(if not all are synced), 
		it will soon run out of "waiters"(working threads) to take the "orders"(HTTP Requests)
 ->using an async methods solves this problem somewhat, given the fact that when a thread is given a specifc task, it can be used for something else aswell
		(like waiter who places and order and then goes back to place more orders; the order he places can be given to the customers by him, or other waiters)

Sync VS Aysnc

Cache vs Database
-------------------
 -> i had a bug now where my code was looking in the cache but not in the database so it would add the same thing more times(a permission someone should only have once, it the cache it wasnt but it the database it was and it kept adding it)
 -> very importnat to invalidate the cache so that the databse and the cache are synced up
