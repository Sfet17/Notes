Eager Loading 
 -> loads all the necessary data, including related data, without waiting for it to be requested
 -> beneficial for performance as it reduces the number of database calls needed

Ex: 
	var userPermission = await context.UserPermissions
					.Include(x => x.Permission)
					.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.UserId == userId && x.Permission.Name == permissionName)

			->
			->
			->
			->
			->
.SaveChangesAysnc() 
	-> it's only used for putting or changing data into a database, NEVER use it with a GET method
!Always check if something is null, some methods bypass try & catch and must be checked with an if!

.FirstorDefault()
	->returns the first value that matches the lamda condition between () or null if there is none
	->it's a sync method (not well used with aysnc functions, because it will block the worker thread)
	->when using an aysnc function use .FirstorDefaultAsync()

!Blocking the Working Thread!
 ->the thread is used for exclusively for the specific task and can't be used for anything else
		(like a waiter who puts an order and then waits until the order is complete) 
 ->a server has a finite amount of working threads, so when most of them(if not all are synced), 
		it will soon run out of "waiters"(working threads) to take the "orders"(HTTP Requests)
 ->using an async methods solves this problem somewhat, given the fact that when a thread is given a specifc task, it can be used for something else aswell
		(like waiter who places and order and then goes back to place more orders; the order he places can be given to the customers by him, or other waiters)
