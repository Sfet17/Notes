======OSI Model======
 -> 7.Application
	-> User Interface: represents the interface between the user and the service(the network)
	-> User Interface: provides network services directly to end-user applications => communicate over a network
	-> Data Representation: ensures that the data is in a format both the receiver and the sender can understand
	-> Protocol Management: HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, DNS.
 -> 6.Presentation
	-> Data Translation: Converts data between different formats (ASCII)
	-> Data Compression: Compresses data in order to reduce size and speed efficiency.
	-> Encryption: Encrypts data before transmission to secure it from unauthorized access.
	-> Decryption: Decrypts incoming data to make it readable for the application layer
	-> Protocol Management: JPEG, PNG, GIF.
 -> 5.Session
	-> it manages, secures and terminates the session between the source application and the destination
	-> it ensures the data transmitted in the session in reliable
	-> it reestablishes it if the session is interrupted
 -> 4.Transport
	-> it manages segmentation of data into smaller packets and directs them to the appropriate application process using port numbers
	-> establishes end to end communication between devices
	-> ensures flow control and error handling
 -> 3.Network

======TCP/IP Model======
 -> 4.Application
 -> 3.Transport
 -> 2.Network
 -> 1.Network Access
========================

======ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)======
 -> the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with an internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
 -> it's LOCAL, if it want to find a device from a different network, it will assign the Ip address and the mac address of the router embedded in the local network.(it maps the default gateway)

======ARP Table======
 -> contains combinations between IP addresses and MAC addresses
=====================

============================================


======CAM(Content Addressable Memory)======
 -> Content Addressable Memory which is a special type of memory used by Cisco switches that returns the address where the data is stored.
 -> best for creating tables that search the exact values, such as MAC address tables (CAM Tables)
 -> faster than RAM since the search the entire memory in one operation
======CAM Table======
 -> they can only provide two result true(1) or false (0)

======ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)======

===================================================


======HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)======
 -> uses 80 port
=============================================

======HTTPs(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)======
 -> uses port 443
=====================================================

======FTP(File Transfer Protocol)======
 -> uses port 20(FTP Data) and 21(FTP Control)
=======================================

======SSH(Secure Shell)======
 -> uses port 22
=============================

======DNS(Domain Name Service)=====
 -> uses port 53
===================================

======DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)======
 -> uses port 67 & 68
 -> configures an Ip dynamically for a device added to a new network(using a portion of it's own mac address)
====================================================

======MAC Address======
 -> it's a unique identifier given to a device that it's used by switches, in a local network, to find where a device is(logically). 
 -> format: six groups of 2 hexadecimal numbers
 	->Ex: FF.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF  <- this is actually the broadcast MAC address  
=======================

======IPv4 Address======
 ->
========================


===========TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)===========

 -> it's a protocol used at the transport level, used for transmitting data between devices
 -> establishes a connection, breaks data into packets and ensures that these packets are delivered
 -> it uses a three way handshake to establish a connection for the transfer
 	Three Way Handshake
		-> the sender sends and SYN packet to the receiver
		-> the receiver responds with an SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge
		-> the sender sends back ACK packet to establish the connection
			SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) packet
			 -> tells the receiver that the sender is likely to segments with
			 -> tells the number the sender will start the communication with 
			SYN-ACK packet
			 -> ACK(Acknowledgement) it tells the sender that response message is received 
			 -> SYN it established the Sequence Number that's likely to start the segments with
			ACK(Acknowledge) packet
			 -> the sender acknowledges the response from the receiver and they establish a secure connection to communicate  
 ---Key Features---
  -> Connection Oriented
	-> establishes a connection via three way handshake
  -> Error Checking
	-> if a packet is corrupted or wasn't transmitted TCP will send that packet again
  -> Flow Control
	-> manages the rate of the data being sent to not be overwhelming to the receiver
  -> Reliable Delivery
	-> ensures the data is being sent accurately and in the correct order

!Best used for reliable data transfer when integrity is top priority!
Examples that use TCP: Email(SMTP, IAMP), Web Transfer(HTTP, HTTPs), File Transfer(FTP)

========================================================


======UDP(User Datagram Protocol)======

 -> it's a transfer layer protocol, used for fast data delivery without guarantying delivery, the order or the amount of data being sent
 -> it's connectionless, it doesn't establish a connection between devices before starting to share data, making it faster than TCP

!Best used for fast data transfer, when speed is more important than integrity!
Examples that use UDP: VoIP(VoiceOverIP), Online gaming, Voice Chat, Streaming Services
=======================================

======Multiplexing======
 ->a method where multiple digital or analog signals are combined into one over a share medium
========================
