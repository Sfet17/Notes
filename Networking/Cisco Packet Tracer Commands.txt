======Setting up a Hostname(Configuring Global Parameters)======
 ->enable 
 -># configure terminal 
 -># hostname name 
 -># enable secret password_name   //sets up an encrypted password(it doesn't show what u type) || enable password password_name(it shows what password you type) not encypted
 -># no ip domain-lookup

//if u set a password and forget to encrypt it
 -> enable password Glontic
 -> service password-encryption


----no ip domain-lookup---
 -> by default cisco devices have  ip domain-lookup enabled => when it doesn't recognize a command or a name it assumes it's a hostname and it tries to connect to it
 -> by enabling no ip domain-lookup it allows cisco devices to stop searching for a hostname that doesn't exist(it's a quality of life command to correct typos or invalid commands)

================================================================


=======Setting up A Banner Message======
 ->banner motd "any symbol that doesn't repeat in the message we want to display"
	'the message we want to display "ending with that character that doesn't show up in the message at all"'
 ->banner motd == Banner Message Of The Day
 ->Ex: banner motd "
	I'm going to school!"
 ->in order to save these changes we need to run the following command:
	->copy running-config startup-config   //it copies the changes we made in the current session(running-config) to the startup config(that runs first when a device boots up)
 !!!We have to end the session before saving it to the startup config (run the command "end" in the current session to exit back to Privileged EXEC)!!!
 -> used for post legal warrnings like  "Unautherized Access Is Prohibited!"
=======================================

======Setting Command Line Access======

 -> configure terminal
 -> line [aux | console | tty | vty] line-number
 -> password password_name
 -> login
 -> exec-timeout minutes
 -> end 


-----Securing the serial console port------

 -> configure terminal
 -> line console 0
 -> password Doof
 -> login
 -> exec-timeout 1
 -> end
------------------------------------------

======================================


======Setting up the Default Gateway on a Router======

 -> enable
 -> conf t
 -> interface GigabitEthernet n/0		//n varies depending on how many networks we want to create a default gateway for; starting with 0
 -> ip address (ip address of the network we want to create the default gateway for) (the subnet mask of that network)
 -> description (something that describes that network, a name)
 -> no shutdown
 -> end
 -> copy running-config startup-config


======================================================

======Configuring a Switch======

 -> enable
 -> conf t
 -> interface vlan 1
 -> ip address (ip address of the switch) (subnet mask of the network)
 -> no shutdown
 -> exit
 -> ip default-gateway (the default gateway for the network)
================================
